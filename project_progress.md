# Project Progress
1. Integrating our volunteer / client application intake webform with our volunteer / client databases
2. Creating a user friendly client application process that also better explains other services a person might be eligible for
3. Creating a daily checklist of items for delivery, pulling data from our client database
4. Data visualizations that help illustrate the impact of MOW Durham, as well as showing the community need
5. Need to keep track of the amount of time that volunteers take to delivery across routes.
6. Maximize enrollment of volunteers given budgetary constraints. How many clients can they serve while still having enough food for everyone? (A math problem he says)
7. MOW Route streamlining (Did not originally prioritize this idea / think it was necessary)
